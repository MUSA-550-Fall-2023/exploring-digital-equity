Hi! We're Stephanie, Jarred, and Alec--three graduate students of the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania, studying City Planning and Urban Spatial Analytics. This website and urban data analysis is our final project for the [MUSA550 Geospatial Data Science in Python](musa-550-fall-2023.github.io) class with our amazing instructor [Nick Hand](https://www.nickhand.dev). Click below the analysis tab at the left to look at our project findings.
